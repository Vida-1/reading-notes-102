## Notes

### 3/23/2022 Such (Cascading) Style!![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102064281/159654491-358521d2-a43c-434b-b99d-6cfc3e0cb2fc.png)

##### - Analogy: A Wireframe is a homeowner's sketch that says I want a bathroom over here, a kitchen over there, an attic and a basement; HTML is the structural engineer's notes on just how to make that happen (OK this wall will need studs, that floor will be stone, and you can have some telecomm lines running in here and there; CSS would be the interior design guru who can magically (without changing your structural engineer's HTML) transform your new house so that it looks like the bridge of the Star Ship Enterprise, Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole abode or the common room of your favorite Hogwart's House.

##### - "Note: A browser is sometimes called a user agent, which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside a computer system. Browsers are the main type of user agent we think of when talking about CSS, however, it is not the only one. There are other user agents available â€” such as those which convert HTML and CSS documents into PDFs to be printed." -From: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS

##### - W3C is one of several standards orgs that publish all web standards (See CSS [Working Group](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) for more info)

##### - Note from lecture on applying padding on stylesheet:    padding: TB LR;   or    padding: top right bottom left;
