### **Notes on Text Editors & Terminal/Command Line**
##### - Word Processors such as MS Word, and WordPerfect comprise one category of text editors. Another category would be code editors such as the simplistic NotePad and the more feature packed Microsoft Visual Studio. 

##### - Selection of a good code editor can greatly affect the efficiency of a software developer. Features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and other extensions that bring additional functionality to bear such as real-time output preview can significantly reduce time lost on bug hunts, iteration, and resource referencing.
