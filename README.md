# A Bit About Vida
#### Mellow greetings from North Carolina (Eastern time zone)! I'm Vida (she/her), Mom to four furkids and pandemic-inspired homeschooler of two (nephews) with a passion for Star Trek, canine rescue, and learning coding. My background is in online support services providing support in retail accounting, commercial real estate underwriting, logistics, and canine rescue. My system is running 64-bit Win 10 Home v.10.0.19044. I love learning new things and am excited about taking this class because I've long had an interest in learning to code and the stars have finally aligned for me to have an opportunity to do so!

### **Explain “growth mindset” in your own words**
##### Having a growth mindset is understanding that people generally aren't just "gifted" or "born with" inate talents. These gifts that we perceive are hard won and acquired through dedicated practice and study. Anyone can be successful at acquiring new skills and abilities if they are willing to put in the work. Further, a growth mindset differs from a fixed mindset in that a fixed mindset may not see the value in failure. There's a popular saying that Edison failed 999 times before he finally succeeded once in creating a viable light bulb. I can't say that those numbers are factually accurate but the idea demonstrates well that failure is integral to eventual success as it helps our minds to grow.

### **Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset**
1. ##### Convert "I screwed it up!" to "Well, I found one way that won't work, now to try a different way!"  
2. ##### Convert "I really stink at this!" to "I'm not very adept at this, YET."  
3. ##### Convert "I give up!" to "I think I'll take two minutes to regroup and try again in a moment."

### **Notes on Text Editors**
#####- Word Processors such as MS Word, and WordPerfect comprise one category of text editors. Another category would be code editors such as the simplistic NotePad and the more feature packed Microsoft Visual Studio. 

##### - Selection of a good code editor can greatly affect the efficiency of a software developer. Features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and other extensions that bring additional functionality to bear such as real-time output preview can significantly reduce time lost on bug hunts, iteration, and resource referencing.
